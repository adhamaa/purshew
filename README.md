## Description

<p align="center">Built with NestJS, this service offers a robust and scalable server-side application for accounting purposes. The API leverages GraphQL for efficient data querying and manipulation, ensuring high performance and flexibility. It utilizes Drizzle ORM for seamless database operations, and PostgreSQL for reliable data storage and retrieval.</p>

      }
    }
    ```

14. copy access token and set as Header for subsequent requests

## Stored Procedure

Here is a PostgreSQL stored procedure for generating a balance sheet:

```sql
  CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE balance_sheet(INOUT result_set refcursor)
  LANGUAGE plpgsql
  AS $$
  BEGIN
      OPEN result_set FOR
    SELECT
          debit_account_name AS "Debit Account",
          debit_amount AS "Amount",
          credit_account_name AS "Credit Account",
          credit_amount AS "Amount",
          description AS "Description"
      FROM
          transactions

      UNION ALL

      SELECT
          'TOTAL' AS debit_account_name,
          SUM(debit_amount) AS debit_amount,
          'TOTAL' AS credit_account_name,
          SUM(credit_amount) AS credit_amount,
